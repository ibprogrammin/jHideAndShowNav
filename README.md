jHideAndShowNav
===============

A jQuery based navigation menu with a twist. You choose how many items you want to be initially visible in the menu, anything after that will be hidden. A link is added that the user can hover over to reveal the remaining items from the menu. 

Feel free to distribute and use at your own leisure and let me know if you come upon any issues.
